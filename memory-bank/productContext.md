# Product Context - Calendar App API

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem Being Solved

**Primary Challenge**: Building robust calendar APIs typically requires extensive manual validation, complex error handling, and maintaining consistency between API documentation, validation logic, and database schemas. This leads to:

- **Validation Inconsistencies**: API validation rules don't match database constraints
- **Documentation Drift**: API docs become outdated as code evolves
- **Manual Error Handling**: Repetitive validation and error response code
- **Type Safety Issues**: Mismatches between API contracts and implementation
- **Developer Friction**: Complex setup and maintenance of validation layers

### The Solution Approach

**Schema-First Development**: Use OpenAPI 3.1 specification as the single source of truth that drives:

- Automatic request/response validation via openapi-backend
- Database model validation using aligned JSON Schema
- API documentation that never goes out of sync
- Type-safe operations with consistent error handling

### Target Market & Users

**Primary Users:**

- **Frontend Developers**: Need reliable calendar backend with predictable API behavior
- **Mobile App Developers**: Require consistent validation and error responses
- **System Integrators**: Need well-documented, standards-compliant calendar API
- **DevOps Teams**: Want containerized, production-ready services

**Secondary Users:**

- **API Consumers**: External systems integrating calendar functionality
- **QA Engineers**: Benefit from comprehensive validation and error handling
- **Technical Writers**: API documentation auto-generated from OpenAPI spec

## How the Product Should Work

### Core User Experience

**For API Consumers:**

1. **Predictable Validation**: All requests validated against OpenAPI schema
2. **Consistent Errors**: Structured error responses with detailed field information
3. **Self-Documenting**: OpenAPI spec available at `/api/openapi.json`
4. **Type Safety**: Responses always match documented schemas

**For Developers:**

1. **Schema-Driven Development**: Update OpenAPI spec, get validation automatically
2. **Database Alignment**: Model validation matches API validation
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: High test coverage with meaningful error scenarios
4. **Easy Deployment**: Docker-first approach with simple setup

### Key Workflows

#### Creating Calendar Events

```
POST /api/events
{
  "title": "Team Meeting",
  "description": "Weekly sync meeting",
  "startDate": "2025-08-01T14:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2025-08-01T15:00:00Z",
  "location": "Conference Room A"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- Automatic validation of all fields against OpenAPI schema
- Database insertion with Objection.js model validation
- Structured success response with created event data
- Proper error responses for validation failures

#### Retrieving Calendar Events

```
GET /api/events
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- Return all events ordered by start date
- Response format matches OpenAPI EventsResponse schema
- Consistent error handling for database issues

### Quality Standards

**Validation Requirements:**

- All requests must pass OpenAPI schema validation
- Database operations must pass Objection.js JSON Schema validation
- Error responses must follow standardized format
- All date/time fields must use ISO 8601 format

**Performance Requirements:**

- Health check endpoint responds within 100ms
- Event creation completes within 500ms
- Event retrieval handles reasonable dataset sizes efficiently

**Reliability Requirements:**

- Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM signals
- Proper database connection cleanup
- Comprehensive error logging with Morgan
- Security headers via Helmet.js

### Integration Points

**Database Integration:**

- PostgreSQL as primary data store
- Knex.js for query building and migrations
- Objection.js for ORM with JSON Schema validation
- Version-controlled database schema management

**API Integration:**

- OpenAPI 3.1 specification drives all validation
- openapi-backend handles routing and validation automatically
- AJV with custom formats for comprehensive validation
- CORS support for cross-origin requests

**Development Integration:**

- Docker Compose for local development environment
- Jest for testing with 95%+ coverage requirements
- Morgan for request logging
- Environment-based configuration

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 95%+ code coverage
- **API Compliance**: 100% OpenAPI schema compliance
- **Error Rate**: < 1% unhandled errors in production
- **Response Time**: < 500ms for CRUD operations

### Developer Experience Metrics

- **Setup Time**: < 5 minutes from clone to running API
- **Documentation Accuracy**: OpenAPI spec always current
- **Validation Consistency**: Zero discrepancies between API and DB validation
- **Error Clarity**: All validation errors include field-level details

### Business Value

- **Reduced Development Time**: Schema-first approach eliminates manual validation code
- **Improved Reliability**: Comprehensive testing and validation reduces bugs
- **Better Maintainability**: Single source of truth for API contracts
- **Enhanced Developer Adoption**: Clear documentation and predictable behavior

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Schema-First Architecture**: Unlike traditional APIs, the OpenAPI spec drives everything
2. **Automatic Validation Alignment**: Database and API validation stay in sync
3. **Production-Ready**: Includes security, logging, and operational concerns from day one
4. **Developer Experience**: Docker-first, comprehensive testing, clear documentation
5. **Type Safety**: End-to-end type consistency from API to database

## Future Vision
