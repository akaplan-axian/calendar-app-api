# Project Brief - Calendar App API

## High-Level Overview

Building a **schema-first REST API for calendar applications** using OpenAPI 3.1, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Objection.js ORM. This is a production-ready API that prioritizes automatic validation, type safety, and developer experience.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goal

Create a robust, validated REST API for calendar event management that follows schema-first development principles where the OpenAPI specification drives both API validation and database operations.

### Key Requirements

- **Schema-First Development**: OpenAPI 3.1 specification defines the complete API contract
- **Automatic Validation**: Seamless request/response validation using openapi-backend
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Objection.js ORM and JSON Schema validation
- **Type Safety**: Alignment between OpenAPI schemas and database models
- **Production Ready**: Security middleware, CORS, logging, error handling, graceful shutdown
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive testing, Docker support, clear documentation

### Core Functionality

- **Calendar Event Management**: Full CRUD operations for calendar events
- **Event Properties**: Title, description, start/end dates, location
- **Data Validation**: Automatic validation of all requests and responses
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and structured error responses
- **Health Monitoring**: Health check endpoints for system monitoring

### Technical Approach

- **API-First Design**: OpenAPI specification drives development
- **Validation Alignment**: Database models use JSON Schema that matches OpenAPI schemas
- **Automatic Routing**: openapi-backend handles routing based on operationIds
- **Database Migrations**: Version-controlled schema management with Knex.js
- **Comprehensive Testing**: High test coverage with Jest (95%+)

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Fully functional REST API with event CRUD operations
- ✅ Automatic request/response validation
- ✅ Production-ready security and error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (95%+)
- ✅ Docker containerization for easy deployment
- ✅ Clear documentation and developer experience
